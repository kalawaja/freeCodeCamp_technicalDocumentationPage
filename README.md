# Technical Documentation Page

> `Certification Project`
> ## Technical Documentation Page
> - This is one of the required projects to earn your certification.
> - For this project, you will build a technical documentation page to serve as instruction or reference for a topic.

> ### **Instructions**
> **Build a Technical Documentation Page** <br>
> <br>
> **Objective:** Build an app that is functionally similar to [Technical Documentation Page](https://technical-documentation-page.freecodecamp.rocks) <br>
> <br>
> **User Stories:**
> 1. You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical
> 2. Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five
> 3. The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section
> 4. Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`)
> 5. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each)
> 6. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each)
> 7. The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each)
> 8. You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`
> 9. The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation
> 10. Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`
> 11. The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar
> 12. Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")
> 13. When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)
> 14. On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user
> 15. Your technical documentation should use at least one media query <br>

> ## **Solutions** <br>
> **Follow Step by Step** <br><br>

> **Step 1** <br>
You can see a `main` element with a corresponding `id="main-doc"`, which contains the page's main content (technical

```html
#index.html

```
```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 2** <br>
Within the `#main-doc` element, you can see several `section` elements, each with a class of `main-section`. There should be a minimum of five

```html
#index.html

```
```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 3** <br>
The first element within each `.main-section` should be a `header` element, which contains text that describes the topic of that section

```html
#index.html

```
> **Step 4** <br>
Each `section` element with the class of `main-section` should also have an `id` that corresponds with the text of each `header` contained within it. Any spaces should be replaced with underscores (e.g. The section that contains the header "JavaScript and Java" should have a corresponding `id="JavaScript_and_Java"`)

```html
#index.html

```
> **Step 5** <br>
The `.main-section` elements should contain at least ten `p` elements total (not each)

```html
#index.html

```
> **Step 6** <br>
The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `code` elements total (not each)

```html
#index.html

```
```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 7** <br>
The `.main-section` elements should contain at least five `li` items total (not each)

```html
#index.html

```
```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 8** <br>
You can see a `nav` element with a corresponding `id="navbar"`

```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 9** <br>
The navbar element should contain one `header` element which contains text that describes the topic of the technical documentation

```css
#styles.css

```
> **Step 10** <br>
Additionally, the navbar should contain link (`a`) elements with the class of `nav-link`. There should be one for every element with the class `main-section`

> **Step 11** <br>
The `header` element in the `#navbar` must come before any link (`a`) elements in the navbar

> **Step 12** <br>
Each element with the class of `nav-link` should contain text that corresponds to the `header` text within each `section` (e.g. if you have a "Hello world" section/header, your navbar should have an element which contains the text "Hello world")

> **Step 13** <br>
When you click on a navbar element, the page should navigate to the corresponding section of the `#main-doc` element (e.g. If you click on a `.nav-link` element that contains the text "Hello world", the page navigates to a `section` element with that id, and contains the corresponding header)

> **Step 14** <br>
On regular sized devices (laptops, desktops), the element with `id="navbar"` should be shown on the left side of the screen and should always be visible to the user

> **Step 15** <br>
Your technical documentation should use at least one media query

> **Note:** Be sure to add ```<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">``` in your HTML to link your stylesheet and apply your CSS <br>
